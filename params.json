The book will gather knowledge we've built over more than a decade, working with legislatures worldwide to re-imagine the technology for drafting, publishing, and accessing legal information. Feel free to comment on the book as it is drafted (what would you like included, argue with us, point out great new ideas or technologies we haven't yet mentioned etc.).\r\n\r\nThe draft outline for the book is [hosted on Github],(https://github.com/aih/LegislativeDataBook/blob/master/TableOfContents.markdown), and below:\r\n\r\nWhat is legislative data?\r\n* Why legislative data?\r\n* Legislative Data, the movie vision\r\n* Legislative Data, the technology\r\n* Scope: what's in and what's out\r\n- In: Laws, bills, Congressional Records, Regulations, Court Opinions\r\n- Out: Legal briefs, FDA Nutrition Labeling\r\n- Neither Out Nor In: Committee Reports, Agency Opinion Letters\r\n* Data Formats: XML, HTML, JSON (oh my)\r\n* Data Standards\r\n- Formal standards\r\n- Practical standards\r\n* Linked Data\r\n* Internationalization\r\n* Best Practices\r\n* Wherein You Participate in Creating Open Legislative Data Standards and Making the Lawmaking Process More Transparent, Democratic and Efficient\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\nThe calendar for drafting is on a public Google Calendar.
