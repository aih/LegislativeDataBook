The book will gather knowledge we've built over more than a decade, working with legislatures worldwide to re-imagine the technology for drafting, publishing, and accessing legal information. Feel free to comment on the book as it is drafted (what would you like included, argue with us, point out great new ideas or technologies we haven't yet mentioned etc.).\r\n\r\nThe draft outline for the book is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/aih/LegislativeDataBook/blob/master/TableOfContents.markdown), and now the calendar for drafting is on a public Google Calendar:\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=332iemhru859a77f8glte2tv0o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles\" style=\"border: 0\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nOh, there are millions of ways to get in touch with us.
